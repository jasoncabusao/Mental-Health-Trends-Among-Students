## Abstract
This study investigates the impact of age, gender, and class standing on college students' mental health, focusing on depression and anxiety. Given the prevalence of these conditions among students and their potential to affect academic performance and social well-being, understanding these relationships is crucial.

### Research Questions
1. How does gender influence students' mental health?
2. What is the relationship between age and students' mental health?
3. Does class standing correlate with students' mental health status?
4. Which age group shows the highest prevalence of depression or anxiety?
5. How do depression and anxiety symptoms vary across genders?

### Purpose and Importance
This research aims to:
1. Identify vulnerable student populations based on demographic factors.
2. Provide insights for targeted mental health interventions in academic settings.
3. Raise awareness about the importance of mental health in academic success.

By examining the relationships between demographic factors and mental health indicators (including depression severity, clinical diagnoses, and suicidal ideation), we seek to inform strategies for early intervention and support. This knowledge can guide parents, educators, and institutions in creating more supportive environments for at-risk students.

The study's findings may help destigmatize mental health issues among students and highlight the need for balanced attention to both academic achievement and psychological well-being. Ultimately, this research contributes to the broader goal of fostering a healthier, more successful student population.

- Purpose: To evaluate and compare various machine learning classification approaches in mental health assessment

## Ethical Considerations and Limitations

This study, while informative, presents several noteworthy limitations and ethical considerations that warrant careful attention. Primarily, the dataset's lack of comprehensive context and explanations may oversimplify the complex nature of mental health issues. The assessment of mental health using only 19 features potentially fails to capture the full spectrum of an individual's psychological state, particularly given that some features employ binary ('TRUE' or 'FALSE') classifications, which may not adequately represent the nuanced nature of mental health statuses.

A significant concern arises from the gender classification within the data. The binary categorization excludes non-binary and other gender identities, potentially misrepresenting a diverse student population. This limitation extends to the exclusion of intersex individuals, forcing a binary classification that may not reflect reality. Moreover, societal expectations and gender norms likely influence mental health outcomes, particularly for those who don't conform to traditional roles, a factor not fully captured in the current dataset.

Methodologically, the use of BMI as a health indicator presents limitations, as it disregards factors such as muscle mass, potentially leading to misinterpretations of health status. The shortage of qualitative data further limits our ability to gain deeper insights into individual experiences and contexts.

The study also highlights a concerning discrepancy between reported anxiety levels and formal depression diagnoses or treatments, suggesting potential gaps in mental health care access or diagnosis procedures within the student population.

From a broader perspective, the polarizing nature of mental health topics may pose challenges to implementing effective policies, as bipartisan support can be difficult to achieve. Additionally, distinguishing between innate sex-related factors and environmental influences on mental health remains a complex challenge that this study may not fully address.

Ethically, researchers must exercise caution to avoid reinforcing harmful stereotypes about gender, mental health, and academic performance. The collection and analysis of sensitive mental health data necessitate rigorous privacy protections and informed consent procedures.

Moving forward, future research in this area should strive for more inclusive data collection methods that recognize diverse gender identities and experiences. This approach would not only enhance the accuracy of the findings but also ensure that the research serves and represents the entire student population more equitably.

In conclusion, while this study provides valuable insights into student mental health trends, its limitations and ethical considerations underscore the need for continued, more comprehensive research in this critical area of student well-being.

## Results and Analysis
We aimed to investigate the relationship between depression severity and various variables including age, gender, and class standing:

According to our first graph, while men have higher number of 'none' to 'none-minimal depression', women have higher number of 'mild' to 'severe depression'. This visualization is significant because it highlights the gender differences in depression prevalence among college students. Although both male and female students may experience depression, the data suggests that female students are more likely to report moderate to severe symptoms. Overall, the chart shows the difference in trends between male and female students.

According to our second graph, it is important to notice that depression often peaks between ages of 19-22. This is important because it can help destigmatize that individuals with depression in their early twenties are alone. This data visualization helps combat the notion that young individuals should be embarrassed to face depression.

According to our last graph, it shows that the higher year of college doesn't increase a students depression severity. There are actually more first year college students with severe depression than fourth year college students with severe depression.

## Key Insights
Through the analysis, we were able to learn the levels of students' depression severity based on their gender (female or male), ages (between 17 years old to 31 years old), and the college years (freshman to senior years). The most important insight includes estimating the prevalence of depression of students, the factors that cause depression, and the impact of depression on academic performances as well as students' well-being.

In more details, the first graph provides insights into the gender based trends in depression among college students. The second graph provides insights into the age related trends in depression among college students and can help to promote greater awareness of mental health issues among young adults. The third graph provides insights into the relationship between college year and depression severity among college students.

The trends and patterns of the charts can be useful to find out the type of therapy that students need or which specfic age group needs more care than the other. The insights gained from analyzing data on students' depression can provide valuable information for creating interventions and support services for the students who are struggling with depression. This not only can help improve their mental health and well-being but also help students improve their academic performance and success.

## Implications
The insights from the data on depression of students can have broad implications for addressing mental health concerns. With the number of students who experience depression, the factors that contribute to depression, and the impacts on academic performance, those who are in charge of taking care of students including parents, teachers, schools, and other organizations can provide better supports for students with depression. The insights can also influence the policies aimed at promoting students' healthy mental health and well-being. For example, the program to reduce students' stress or depression can be created for schools.

Additionally, understanding the impact of depression on students, schools and other organizations can work to reduce the negative attitudes and stereotypes on mental illness. This can promote a more supportive environment where students can think that mental illness is not something that they need to hide. This can allow students feel more comfortable seeking help and support, which will eventually improve students' mental health and well-being, not only among students but also in society.
